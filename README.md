This academic project was focused on a real-world business case, in which classification models were developed to predict bicycle purchases. Additionally, clustering techniques were applied for customer segmentation and to support strategic decision-making related to the company’s international expansion.

## Objectives

* Predict the probability that customers will purchase bicycles
* Segment customers based on product type (Kinder, Basic, or Sport bicycles)
* Identify international markets with profiles similar to the current market to support geographic expansion

## Methodology

* Data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Supervised learning models:

  * Decision Trees
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Logistic Regression
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, and cost matrices
* Unsupervised learning using clustering techniques (Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means)
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for market similarity analysis

## Results

* The KNN model achieved the best performance (75% accuracy, 73% recall).
* Customers with a high probability of purchase were identified for targeted marketing campaigns.
* Customer segments aligned with specific bicycle types were defined.
* International cities with socio-economic profiles similar to the local market were proposed.
